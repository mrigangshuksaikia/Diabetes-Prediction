# Diabetes-Prediction
Detecting if an user is diabetic or not

Predicting if the user get a positive result (Diabetic) or negative result (Not - Diabetic) using parameters such as :

1. Pregnancies
2. Glucose
3. BloodPressure
4. SkinThickness
5. Insulin
6. BMI
7. Diabetes Pedigree Function
8. Age

Model Training and Prediction :
We can train our prediction model by analyzing existing data because we already know whether each patient has diabetes. This process is also known as supervision and learning. The trained model is then used to predict if users suffer from diabetes. The training and prediction process is described as follows:

Splitting:
First, data is divided into two parts using component splitting. In this experiment, data is split based on a ratio for the training set and the prediction set. The training set data is used in the logistic regression component for model training

The following classification model is used - Logistic Regression
